# React Router v6 Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using `react-router-dom` v6: routes not rendering components.  The problem often stems from a missing `BrowserRouter` wrapper or incorrect path definitions.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a React component that utilizes `react-router-dom` v6.  However, the routes defined within the component fail to render the correct components.  This is due to a missing or incorrectly configured `BrowserRouter` wrapper.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers the corrected version.  The primary change is the addition of the `BrowserRouter` component, correctly wrapping the `Routes` component.  Additionally, it ensures the path definitions in `Route` components are accurate.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe that the initial bug is present in the `bug.js` version.
6. The corrected version can be found in `bugSolution.js`.
